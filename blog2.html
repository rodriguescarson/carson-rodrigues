            <h1>FOMO</h1>
            <small>September, 2020</small>
            <p>
                I came across this concept of FOMO(FEAR OF MISSING OUT) fews months back. It all started when I was a kid. I mean my child was great.Surrounded by lots of friends and people growing up was a blessing. My building had a garden and we use to play a lot. Every month you would see a new guy showing up there. There was a time my friend group was
                around 20 people. We had to make two groups just so that everyone could play. It was fun and everything
                but life went on. The group started becoming small and people starting moving out. So to compansiate for
                the lack of social life, I started doing other stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like in 6th standard only I started going for taekwondo classes and piano classes alternate everyday.
                Yoga or hockey pratices in the morning. Build my first website in 6th standard using html and css, worked
                on few projects after that. Participated in every competiton in school over the years cause I thought I could do more. Participated in quiz, science fairs and what not. The amount of participation certificates will make you think this guy had no life. I got my black belt in two years.Wanted more went for boxing for 2 months. There was a point a played karate also and won.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking back this was a problem. Sure I did a lot of stuff and met a lot of people. But the fomo I get
                now is on a different level. Sometimes I feel I'll be a workholic at this rate, lol. Last month I had
                lot of stuff to do, since I enrolled in lot of things but ended up doing nothing. Even social media has
                played a big part. Every ad that comes will just add up to FOMO.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way I plan to solve this is by unlearning things I don't need. Take a breath everytime I feel I want
                to do something new and rethink the situation. Priroitize only things which will help me in next years.
                This should work and hopefully I get control over fomo.

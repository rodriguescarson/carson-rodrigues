            <h1>My Sales Intern Experience at WhiteHatJr</h1>
            <small>September, 2020</small>
            <p>
                While working at WhiteHatJr as a User engagement Intern in my 2nd year of computer engineering, I have learnt that sales is more important then coding. Let's go back to how my journey started and how sales in a startup is a must experience. Around the month of May I registerd to intern at  WhiteHatJr. Soon  I  got a call form the HR for the interview. I cleared my round and gave all the required documents to intern there. I was very excited to work there. The stipend was great for a noob sales. We even got to be in a zoom call with Kapil Dev, the living cricket legned of India. Superb start.

                First week we were trained how to pitch their product. Due to legal reasons I can't tell you a lot about a lot of things about the company. We had to use different softwares to manage clients and keep recordings of our call my audit purposes. I used to make around 80 calls a day and most of them use to not pick up the call. But the few who use to pick up, I had to make sure I converted them to use our product. It was such a rush. Convince someone on call who you never met to use our product, that was tough. We had to follow a script and yet whatever you said could make a difference between the client using our product and they never using it. I had to make sure to sell so I could get daily bonuses. Who would even miss that. It was like chess, every move had to be calculated but in less then a second.

                I had never even tried to sell anything in my life. But this experience helped me to talk to strangers, make some small talks, be kind no matter how the other person responds and most importantly be show the same enthusiasm every single time you talk to a different person. Plus my hindi was a little bad. Should  have mentioned I understand hindi and can't talk in hindi in my resume. I'm sure the auditors had a good laugh listing to my hindi. Regardless I made sure I pronounced the words properly after lots of practice and help from my intern friends, who by the way were strangers themself, sailing on the same boat.

                They were alot funny calls. Once I called the police station and I just started pitching diretly to her. She then stopped me and told me this is the police station and I'll put you in. But I handled the situation pretty well. That was scary. Some other time I called this person, but the kid picked up. I asked if I can talk to the parents. So he ran with the phone, fell on the ground and he started calling. I could't stop laughing (ofcourse on mute).

                To be honest it was very frustrating in the beginning. I didn't have much stamina to call so many people. But my mentors were always an inspiration. We had meetings every morning and evening to know our performance and help us understand where we can improve. And the motivational speeches we use to get were like tedx talks,lol. Overtime it didn't really get easier but I got the strenght to do my work efficently. I guess consisteny does helps a lot.

                Sadly after a month I had to resign to concentrate on my engineering. I wish I could be part of it for a longer time but it was for the best. When I told my intern friends on our unofficial group, they started crying through emojis. Some even called to know and say goodbye. Which was totally unexpected. One month can make strangers into family. But we life goes on. Day one me and last day me, were two different people. I was more confident, I could manage my time efficently, I could understand why sales is so important in  any  business. I think most important  thing was I was implementing my sales skills more then learning because of which I got exponential growth. Yea, folks thats it for now.I hope you all enjoyed it. Fin.
